# About Me

> _"The mystery of life isn't a problem to solve, but a reality to experience."_
>
> Frank Herbert

I am called The Voice That Cooks. Not just because I'm a voice actor who loves to cook, but because my voice has plenty of flavors to spice up the tone, energy, and authenticity you need for your characters. And if your character happens to be a chef making a delicious meal, all the better! I have played caclking crazies, dragonborn bards, supervillains, gruff soldiers, nervous nerds, and more! I also have plenty of experience with improv and I'm reliable with communication and wanting to get the character right for you! 

Email me anytime. I'd love to cook up something with you. 

And while you're here, feel free to listen to my podcasts that are available on my website: Voices That Cook and One Shots: D&D Character Podcast!
