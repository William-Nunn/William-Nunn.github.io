# About Me

> _"The mystery of life isn't a problem to solve, but a reality to experience."_
>
> Frank Herbert

Where to start. First of all, hello there. Second, I'm a nerd. Probably should be aware of that right away. Third, I also love is voice acting! I love getting behind a microphone and play all sorts of characters. Whether they be caclking crazies, dragonborn bards, supervillains, gruff soldiers, nervous nerds, or just the guy next door, I'm more than happy to give your character the passion and attention it deserves in the epic story you want to bring to life! 

I'm also called The Voice That Cooks. Not just because I'm a voice actor who loves to cook, but because my voice has plenty of flavors to spice up the tone, energy, and authenticity you need for your characters. And if your character happens to be a chef making a delicious meal, all the better! And bonus points for plenty of improv experience! Extra extra bonus points: I'm reliable with communication and wanting to get the character right for you. 

Email me anytime. I'd love to cook up something with you. 

And while you're here, feel free to listen to my podcasts that are available on my website: Voices That Cook and One Shots: D&D Character Podcast!
